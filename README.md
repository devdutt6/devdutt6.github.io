## Technology

This project is built using **Next.js** in old page route structure. With **no-extra dependency** then the project next.js bundled with, not even Tailwind which is my favorite way of styling.

## Features

The terminal accepts various commands like `help`, `welcome`, `about` etc.(# Note Use the `help` command to list out all the acceptable commands)

It also has the **autocomplete** feature which will help you autocomplete the commands.

[To use autocomplete write 1 or 2 characters and press tab]

This terminal also has support for well-known keyboard short-cuts like <kbd>ctrl + l</kbd>, <kbd>&#8593; Up arrow</kbd>, <kbd>&#8595; Down arrow</kbd> to navigate in history.
I would insist trying out the `theme` command there are many themes I integrated in this terminal.
